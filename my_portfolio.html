            <ol>
                <li>"It's not the fear of doing it, it's the fear of the thought of doing it." -Me</li>
                <li>"I was born in the wrong generation." -every Beatles/LZ/ACDC/Nirvana/DavidBowie/Queen/classicmusic YouTuber ever (many variations exist)</li>
                <li>"The only rule that ever made sense to me I learned from a history, not an economics, professor at Wharton. 'Fear,' he used to say, "fear is the most valuable commodity in the universe." That blew me away. "Turn on the TV," he'd say. "What are you seeing? People selling their products? No. People selling the fear of you having to live without their products..." Fear of aging, fear of loneliness, fear of poverty, fear of failure. Fear is the most basic emotion we have. Fear is primal. Fear sells." -Max Brooks</li>
                <li>The final frontier is not a land we can conquer. It is not twenty-thousand leagues under the sea, vastly unexplored and vastly unknown. It is not the end of the universe, which we apparently know about more than the ocean trenches. No, the <em>true</em> final frontier is something that we will very likely never completely and fully conquer and claim. The final frontier is something humans have made, are making every second, and <em>will</em> make until the day we wither away from the face of the Earth, or all of existence. The final frontier... is history." -me</li>
