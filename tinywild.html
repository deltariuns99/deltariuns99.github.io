    <h3>
        Too Small for the Past and the Present
    </h3>
</p>

    The arid atmosphere fell absolutely silent. A hellish silence had befallen Tinywild as if a giant pillow had been forced upon the population, smothering it. A gust
     of unusually warm air drifted through the main street of the seemingly-deserted settlement, whipping up sporadic currents of dust and salt that swirled through
      the streets and alleys. The evacuations had all but ceased to exist; it was deemed far too dangerous for any innocent bystanders to be wandering around the streets
       while bullets and cannon fire zipped and darted everywhere around. Waiting on the tracks, just by Fort Weissman, was the final train out of Tinywild, the Central
        Pacific Jupiter. It sat motionless and noiseless, an empty vessel that contained no engineers and boasted no passengers, awaiting its final fate.

	The hills were teeming with life and abnormal activity, much more activity than normally expected. Forming behind the hills and just over the canyon walls was an 
	entire brigade of the Metropolitan Offensive Overwatch, teeming seven-thousand in numbers. In their march to find Object 42, the 52nd Atlantean Infantry Division had
	 completely encompassed- and was still encompassing- a growing number of the smaller settlements like a river engulfing the random stone or tree trunk jutting out of
	  the water. Tinywild was just another outcropping that was soon to be overwhelmed by the fury and swiftness of the coursing river of fire and steel.

    Meanwhile, Teddy sat precariously on the roof of the Salisbury Saloon, reclining on the slanted roof, his back to the cluster of hills that lay about 300 meters 
    from the saloon. He fingered the action of his Sharps rifle, attempting to field-strip the thing. Suddenly, Sheriff Matthew emerged on the balcony of the saloon
     and turned around, looking up at Teddy. “Ted!” barked the former sharply, adjusting his hat. “Stop screwin’ ‘round with your rifle and keep a lean eye out for 
     any ruffians!”
</p>
<p>
    “Shut your mouth!” snapped back Teddy. “I’m try’na dislodge a damn rock from the barrel!”
</p>
<p>
    “I’ll dislodge your head if your persistence to refuse orders and piss us all the hell off does not falter!”
</p>
<p>
    “I <em>have</em> been keepin’ an eye out, mind you! And what the hell have you been doin’ down there?”
</p>
<p>
    “We’re try’na pinpoint the exact location of them Atlanteans. We’ve got a few eyes out at the moment but they haven’t told us jack yet.
</p>
<p>
    “They’re everywhere,” Teddy said as he shook his head. “The hills are alive, crawlin’ head to toe with them bastards. As a matter of fact, I’m bettin’ that
     they’ve completely surrounded us by now! At any moment, they could attack us, right here and right now!”
</p>
<p>
    A familiar call echoed from inside the saloon, assisted with the harmonics of the ambient buildings, and found its way into Sheriff Matthew’s ears.
     “Sheriff Matthew!” called Wyatt. “The scouts are comin’ back. And I believe them to be the bearer of bad news!”
